# kbilling-js-dummy

This is a trivial JavaScript source repo for [KillingBilling](https://www.killingbilling.com/) projects.

This repo contains no [billing plans](https://www.killingbilling.com/docs/billing-plans), but it builds with Node.js and you can fork it and deploy to KillingBilling. Then, maybe, develop your own billing plans in JavaScript and see [what happens](https://www.killingbilling.com/docs/getting-started).
